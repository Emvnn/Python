# Python Data Structures Comparison

| Data Structure | Ordered | Mutable | Allows Duplicates | Key-Value Pairs | Syntax Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **List**      | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚ùå No          | `[1, 2, 3]` |
| **Dictionary** | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚ùå No (Keys)     | ‚úÖ Yes         | `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}` |
| **Set**       | ‚ùå No   | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚ùå No            | ‚ùå No          | `{1, 2, 3}` |
| **Tuple**     | ‚úÖ Yes  | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚ùå No          | `(1, 2, 3)` |

## Summary
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable, and allows duplicates. Best for sequences.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, ordered (since Python 3.7), mutable, and keys must be unique.
- **Sets**: Unordered, mutable, and only unique elements. Great for membership tests.
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable, and allows duplicates. Used for fixed collections of items.

# üöÄ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**  

## üîç **What is OOP?**  
OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which combine **data** and **behavior**. It makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Concepts Demonstrated in this Project**  

1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
   - **Object**: An instance of a class.  

   _Example:_  
   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, make, model):
           self.make = make
           self.model = model

       def display_info(self):
           return f"This car is a {self.make} {self.model}."

   # Creating an object
   my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
   print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: This car is a Toyota Camry.
   ```  

2. **Encapsulation**  
   - Restricting access to internal variables to ensure data integrity.  

   _Example:_  
   ```python
   class BankAccount:
       def __init__(self, balance):
           self.__balance = balance  # Private variable

       def deposit(self, amount):
           self.__balance += amount
           return f"New Balance: ${self.__balance}"

   account = BankAccount(1000)
   print(account.deposit(500))  # Output: New Balance: $1500
   ```

3. **Inheritance**  
   - Reusing functionality by deriving a new class from an existing class.  
   ```python
   class Animal:
       def speak(self):
           return "Animal sound"

   class Dog(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Woof!"

   dog = Dog()
   print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!
   ```  

4. **Polymorphism**  
   - Allowing methods to behave differently depending on the calling object.  

   _Example:_  
   ```python
   class Bird:
       def fly(self):
           return "Birds can fly."

   class Penguin(Bird):
       def fly(self):
           return "Penguins cannot fly."

   bird = Bird()
   penguin = Penguin()
   print(bird.fly())     # Output: Birds can fly.
   print(penguin.fly())  # Output: Penguins cannot fly.
   ```

# What are APIs?
APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They act as bridges that enable interaction between different systems, software, or services without needing to understand the internal workings of each. APIs can be thought of as messengers that take a request, relay it to another system, and then return the response.

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

To separate the chicken, beef, and pork, you could create a programmed rule in the format of if-else statements. This allows the machine to recognize what is on the label and route it to the correct basket. 

A programmed rule might look something like this:

```python
if beef_is_on_label:
    route_items_to_center_basket()

else:
    redirect_item_to_main_basket()
```
Artificial intelligence makes this process more efficient.

---
## MACHINE LEARNING

To improve the performance of the machine, you expose it to more data to ensure that the machine is trained on numerous characteristics of each type of meat, such as size, shape, and color. The more data you provide for the algorithm, the better the model gets. By providing more data and adjusting parameters, the machine minimizes errors by repetitive guess work.

## DEEP LEARNING

The grocery store has expanded its selection to include more products such as chicken tenders, ground beef, and wild boar. In addition, the products now come in different sizes, shapes, and seasonings. What makes deep learning different?

Deep learning models eliminate the need for feature extractions. For your work in the meat department, you decide to use algorithms based on deep learning to sort meat by removing the need to define what each product looks like. Feature extraction is built into the process without human input. Once you have provided the deep learning model with dozens of meat pictures, it processes the images through different layers of neural networks. The layers can then learn an implicit representation of the raw data on their own.

## The Era of AI

Early in the summer of 1956, a small group of researchers, led by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, gathered at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. There, at one of the oldest colleges in the United States, they launched a revolution in scientific research and coined the term ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù.

# **Understanding Data and Its Types**  

## **What is Data?**  

Data is raw information that can take many forms, including **facts, statistics, opinions, and recorded content** like voices, photos, names, and even dance moves!  

## **Types of Data**  

Data can be categorized into **three main types**:  

### **1. Structured Data** üìä  
- Highly organized and typically **quantitative**.  
- Stored in a tabular format (rows and columns).  
- Easily processed by conventional data tools like **Excel** and **SQL databases**.  
- **Examples:** Names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, and stock information.  

### **2. Unstructured Data (Dark Data)** üì∑  
- Typically **qualitative** and lacks a predefined structure.  
- Cannot be easily processed by traditional data tools.  
- Requires **advanced analytics** (AI, NLP, Computer Vision) for meaningful insights.  
- **Examples:** Images, texts, customer comments, medical records, and song lyrics.  

### **3. Semi-Structured Data** üîó  
- The **bridge** between structured and unstructured data.  
- Lacks a strict predefined model but contains **metadata** for better organization.  
- Easier to **store, search, and analyze** than unstructured data.  
- **Example:** A **video on social media**‚Äîthe video itself is unstructured, but text-based metadata (hashtags, captions) makes it searchable.  

By understanding these data types, we can better manage, analyze, and extract valuable insights from different kinds of information! üöÄ

## **Machine Learning (ML) Overview**  

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming.  

**How It Works:**  
ML algorithms identify patterns in structured and unstructured data, improving performance over time through experience.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Learns from Data:** Improves accuracy by analyzing past data.  
- **Predicts Outcomes:** Makes data-driven decisions.  
- **Handles Complex Data:** Works with structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.  

**Applications:**  
Used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, medical diagnostics, and more. üöÄ

---
## Supervised learning 

Supervised learning is about providing AI with enough examples to make accurate predictions. 

All supervised learning algorithms need **labeled data**. Labeled data is data that is grouped into samples that are tagged with one or more labels.

For example, the information might be drawings and photos of animals, some of which are dogs and are labeled ‚Äúdog‚Äù. The machine will learn by identifying a pattern for ‚Äúdog‚Äù. When the machine sees a new dog photo and is asked, ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù, it will respond, ‚Äúdog‚Äù, with high accuracy. This is known as a **classification problem**.

---
## unsupervised learning
In **unsupervised learning**, a person feeds a machine a large amount of information, asks a question, and then the machine is left to figure out how to answer the question by itself.

For example, the machine might be fed many photos and articles about dogs. It will classify and cluster information about all of them. When shown a new photo of a dog, the machine can identify the photo as a dog, with reasonable accuracy.

Unsupervised learning occurs when the algorithm is not given a specific ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù outcome. Instead, the algorithm is given unlabeled data. 
---
## Reinforcement learning
**Reinforcement learning** is a machine learning model similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn‚Äôt trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes is reinforced to develop the best recommendation for a given problem. The foundation of reinforcement learning is rewarding the ‚Äúright‚Äù behavior and punishing the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù behavior.
